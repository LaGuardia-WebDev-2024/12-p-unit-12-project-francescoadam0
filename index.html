The traning here is very serious and the goal is to produce to be the best dancers we could be and prepare us for college and the real world. Being accepted into this program in 2021 was truly life changing and opned up so many new doors for me and I am forever immesly grateful I got to go to highschool at THE FAME SCHOOL. If you want to dance professionally, this is the place you should be. Thank you to the dance faculty for everything you have done for me over the last 4 years "

The only down sight is that you have to wait 4 years for your first real preformance because we are solely based as a training school and not a preformance school. These weeks rehersing and preforming were probably one of the best weeks of senior year. It is alot of fun so upcoming seniors, be prepared!! "

Ms. Hall has hads down been my favorite teacher at LaGuardia and is devoted to her craft in making us students get the most out of this class by learning as much as new coding skills and techniques possible. This class has been filled with laughter and joy and I have to say although we all do not know everyone in this room, the enviornment we walk into feels so welcoming. Thank you Ms.Hall for all you have done not only for me but for the entire class this entire year. The memories I have made and the bonds I have created within Room 640 are some that I will remember forever. Upcoming seniors, this is a course I would strongly recommend!")
